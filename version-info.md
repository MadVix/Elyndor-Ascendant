### üÜï Skender v2.1 (Released: 11.06.2025)

Please update the files mentioned below, main.py doesn't have to be updated.

#### üîß Fixed multiple bugs.
- Updated `bot.py`, `database/__init__.py`, `utilities.py`.
- Updated `main.py`, but only to change the bot_version variable to v2.1

#### üí° Clarification
- Users only gain xp if levels have been created (use `change-levels`) but they will still earn passive chat income.
- Clarification: the excluding / including of specific channels for gaining xp also applies to passive chat income.

### ‚ùå Not added

- **Transaction history**: intentionally omitted because:
    - Transaction data is already public in server channels
    - Would unnecessarily increase database operations and saved data

---

### üóëÔ∏è Removed from Legacy Version

- Nothing has been removed.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Mid-/Long-Term Roadmap

- Allow multiple users to bet on the same roulette game.
