---- Command list and tips for Skender Bot v2.0 ----

List of commands available for Skender Bot in python.
Official Repo: https://github.com/NoNameSpecified/UnbelievaBoat-Python-Bot, for setup see readme.md.
Here I use the prefix "+" but you can change it to whatever you want in main.py.
Info: <this> means that the parameter is obligatory, [this] means that it is optional.

0. Information
  Help page: +help


1. Mini-Games
  Blackjack: +blackjack <bet>
  Roulette: +roulette <bet> <space>


2. Balance & Money
  Economy Stats: +stats
  Check Balance: +balance
  Deposit money: +deposit <amount or all>
  Withdraw money. +withdraw <amount or all>
  Give money: +give <@member> <amount or all>
  Server Leaderboard: +leaderboard [page] [-cash | -bank | -total]

2.1 Balance & Money -- Admin Commands.
  +add-money <@member> <amount>
  +remove-money <@member> <amount> [cash/bank]
    info: default is bank
  +add-money-role <@role> <amount>
  +remove-money-role <@role> <amount>
    info: removes from bank. If amount > user balance, it will set his balance to 0.
  +clear-db
    info: removes users that left the server from database (forever).


3. Income Commands
  +slut
  +crime
  +work
  +rob


4. Customization -- only for admins.
  +module-info [module]
    Get module (income commands) info. You can use this info to later edit the values.
    If you don't know the module names, just use +module without any parameter.
  +change-variable <variable> <new value>
    Change variable settings
    Tip: see +module first and then use change-variable.
  +change-action <action_name> <variable> <new value>
    Change action variable, for example the delay to play blackjack.
  +change-currency <new emoji name>
    Change the custom currency emoji. It has to be an emoji you uploaded to the server, not a discord-wide one.
  +set-income-reset <false/true>
    Change "income reset". By default, it is set to "true".
    This means that (if you use collect and not update-income, see below!) the daily salary will NOT accumulate.
    i.e. if you call it, you get X€, if you wait 3 days, you get X€ again.
    If you set-income-reset to "false", the user would get (days passed * X€).
  +set-passive-chat-income <amount>
    Passive chat income means that the user receives a certain sum for being active and sending messages.
    The cooldown for this is the same as for gaining xp per message.


5. Items
  +buy-item <item name> <amount>
  +give-item <@member> <item name> <amount>
  +inventory [page]
    Info: see your own inventory
  +user-inventory <@member> [page]
    Info: see inventory of another user
  +use <item name> <amount>
  +catalog [item-short-name]
    If you just use +catalog, you will get a list of all items available.
    If you use +catalog name, you will get detailed information on the specific item.

5.1 Items -- Admin Commands
  +create-item
  +delete-item <item name>
    Info: removes the item completely, for everyone.
  +remove-user-item <@member> <item short name> <amount>
  +spawn-item <@member> <item short name> [amount]
    Info: this will spawn an (already created) item in a user inventory.


6. Income Roles. Whoever has the role will get income - the income is daily (i.e. 100 means 100 a day).
  +list-roles
  +collect
    User will get their salary. Can/should be disabled depending on if you want to use update-income.
    If income-reset is set to true, the user can only get 1 times his income. If set to false, he gets missed_days * income.

6.1 Income Roles -- Admin Commands.
  +add-income-role <@role> <income>
  +remove-income-role <@role>
  +update-income-role <@role> <new income>
  +update-income.
    This is to pay ALL users who have the role.
    It can be used once a week for example, or whenever you want. Beware of income_reset, it also
    impacts this command.

    Personal tip: just leave it at collect, with income_reset set to true (as it is by default) and don't use update-income.
    If you do use update-income, you should consider changing income_reset to false and disabling collect.
    To disable collect, go to bot.py, look for >> elif command in ["collect" ... << and comment that block out.


7. Levels.
  +level [@member]
    See your own current level or the level of a pinged member
  +all-levels
    See a list of all levels you can obtain, including rewards
  +level-lb [page]
    Shows a leaderboard, ranked by level.

7.1 Levels -- Admin Commands
  +change-levels
    Change levels, level rewards and xp channels.
  +add-xp <@member> <amount>
  +remove-xp <@member> <amount>

  info: to change passive chat income, please use +set-passive-chat-income
