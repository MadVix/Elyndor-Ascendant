---- Command list and tips for Skender Bot v2.0 ----

List of commands available for Skender Bot in python.
Official Repo: https://github.com/NoNameSpecified/UnbelievaBoat-Python-Bot, for setup see readme.md.
Here I use the prefix "+" but you can change it to whatever you want in main.py.
Info: <this> means that the parameter is obligatory, [this] means that it is optional.

0. Information
  Help page: +help

1. Mini-Games
  Blackjack: +blackjack <bet>
  Roulette: +roulette <bet> <space>

2. Balance & Money
  Economy Stats: +stats
  Check Balance: +balance
  Deposit money: +deposit <amount or all>
  Withdraw money. +withdraw <amount or all>
  Give money: +give <@member> <amount or all>
  Server Leaderboard: +leaderboard [page] [-cash | -bank | -total]

2.1 Staff Commands for economy:
  +add-money <@member> <amount>
  +remove-money <@member> <amount> [cash/bank]
    info: default is bank
  +add-money-role <@role> <amount>
  +remove-money-role <@role> <amount>
    info: removes from bank. If amount > user balance, it will set his balance to 0.
  +clear-db
    info: removes users that left the server from database (forever).

3. Income Commands
  +slut
  +crime
  +work
  +rob

4. Customization
  +module-info [module]
    Get module (income commands) info. You can use this info to later edit the values.
    If you don't know the module names, just use +module without any parameter.
  +change-variable <variable> <new value>
    Change variable settings
    Tip: see +module first and then use change-variable.
  +change-action <action_name> <variable> <new value>
    Change action variable, for example the delay to play blackjack.
  +change-currency <new emoji name>
    Change the custom currency emoji. It has to be an emoji you uploaded to the server, not a discord-wide one.
  +set-income-reset <false/true>
    Change "income reset". By default, it is set to "true".
    This means that (if you use collect and not update-income, see below!) the daily salary will NOT accumulate.
    i.e. if you call it, you get X€, if you wait 3 days, you get X€ again.
    If you set-income-reset to "false", the user would get (days passed * X€).

5. Items
  +create-item (admin role required)
  +delete-item <item name> (admin role required)
    info: remove the item completely, for everyone.
  +remove-user-item <@member> <item short name> <amount> (admin role required)
    info: this will remove one or more items from a user's inventory.
  +spawn-item <@member> <item short name> [amount] (admin role required)
    info: this will spawn an (already created) item in a user inventory.
  +buy-item <item name> <amount>
  +give-item <@member> <item name> <amount>
  +inventory [page]
    info: see your own inventory
  +user-inventory <@member> [page]
    info: see inventory of another user
  +use <item name> <amount>
  +catalog [item-short-name]
    if you just use +catalog, you will get a list of all items available.
    if you use +catalog name, you will get detailed information on the specific item.

6. Income Roles. Whoever has the role will get income - the income is daily (i.e. 100 means 100 a day).
  +add-income-role <@role> <income> (admin role required)
  +remove-income-role <@role> (admin role required)
  +update-income-role <@role> <new income> (admin role required)
  +list-roles
  +collect
    User will get their salary. Can/should be disabled depending on if you want to use update-income.
    If income-reset is set to true, the user can only get 1 times his income. If set to false, he gets missed_days * income.

  +update-income (admin role required). This is to pay all users who have the role.
                  It can be used once a week for example, or whenever you want. Beware of income_reset, it also
                   impacts this command.

    Personal tip: just leave it at collect, with income_reset set to true (as it is by default) and don't use update-income.
    If you do use update-income, you should consider changing income_reset to false and disabling collect.
        To disable collect, go to bot.py, look for >> elif command in ["collect" ... << and comment that block out.

7. XP (Skender v2.0 and upwards includes xp aka levels and passive chat income).
  +add-xp <@member> <amount>
  +remove-xp <@member> <amount>
